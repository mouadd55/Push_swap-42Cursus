## ðŸ’¡ About the project

> _This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting._

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/mouadd55/Push_swap-42Cursus/blob/62df8f9be4a4bbba68bb7b1978234b6b11bedf15/push_swap.pdf).

## Overview
The Push_Swap project is an algorithmic challenge that aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions in the most efficient way possible.
- The limited set of instructions are:

| Operation | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `sa` | swap A - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A |
| `sb` | swap B - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` at the same time |
| `pa` | push A - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of A |
| `pb` | push B - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of B |
| `ra` | rotate A - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rb` | rotate B - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` at the same time |
| `rra` | reverse rotate A - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate B - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time |

## Objectives
- Understand and implement sorting algorithms.
- Learn about algorithmic complexity.
- Rigorous use of C programming language.

## Common Instructions
- Written in C.
- No memory leaks allowed.
- Makefile with specific rules is required.
- Error handling is essential.

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd push_swap
make

Then run it with :

```shell
./push_swap <numbers>
```

The numbers provided can be positive or negative integers. There must not be any duplicates. For example :

```shell
./push_swap 9 0 -217 2147483647 -2147483648
```

If the arguments are valid, the program will output the most efficient list of actions to sort the list.

The program can be checked with the provided checker, like this :

```shell
ARG="3 0 9 2 -1"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
